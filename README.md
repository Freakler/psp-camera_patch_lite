# camera_patch_lite

This plugin can add right analog stick support to PSP games on the Adrenaline eCFW. 


#### Installation:
Copy the .prx & .ini files to your seplugins folder and add "ms0:/seplugins/camera_patch_lite.prx 1" to the game.txt file.


#### Notes:
This does not involve actual game patching but only shortcuts the already build-in camera controls of those games to the analog stick. Depending on the game this will work differently good or bad! Like sometimes there might be a small delay or you'll only be able to look left or right, but thats all game depending and better than nothing imo. Also if a game uses a trigger button + the left analog stick for camera movement you obviously won't be able to walk and move the camera at the same time for example.

Also some games are disabled by default in the .ini file due to the native patches by TheFlow. Use those plugins instead!
